This is Sky Warriors, a very small multiplayer game, written in Python using
the pygame library. It took almost two days to write it from scratch and
it was our Final Project[1] for the IPW NetApp Course[2]. It's very buggy at
the moment, and it doesn't work quite well, but it's still playable. Maybe
i'll find some time in the near future and make it a really enjoyable game.

1) Start the server: ./server PORT
		i.e.: $ ./server 1234

2) Start the two clients: ./client HOST PORT
		i.e. $ ./client 192.168.1.10 1234

Pay attention to run the clients with the same port as that opened with the 
server. You can run both clients and the server on the same computer from 
different terminals.
	i.e.:
		- terminal 1: $ ./server 1234
		- terminal 2: $ ./client localhost 1234
		- terminal 3: $ ./client localhost 1234
